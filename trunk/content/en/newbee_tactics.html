<li><b>Vocabulary</b>
<p>
Here are some relevant terms that you will read in this article and online:
	<ul>
		<li> <i>con</i> - enemy aircraft (used very often online) </li>
		<li> <i>grab</i> - climb </li>
		<li> <i>zoom</i> - climb rapidly </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</li>


<li><b>Altitude</b>
	<p>
	Grabbing after take-off is vital because having an altitude advantage gives you a considerable measure of control over an engaement. With this, the con's orientation with respect to you is irrelevant (even if they are directly behind you at a lower altitude). When sufficiently higher than your foe, you can easily reposition yourself to an offensive perch. Offensively, altitude allows you to choose the most convenient path by which to attack your foe. Defensively, altitude allows you to delay engagement with your foe and convert a height advantage to a speed advantage to flee if necessary. For small arenas where fields are often less than 1 map sector apart, climbing to 9,000 or 10,000 feet is usually enough. However, for larger arenas where fields are more widely spaced, you may have to climb as high as 14,000 feet in order to be safe or be well positioned to ambush cons.

<li><b>Situational Awareness</b>
	<p>
	Eventually, after reaching your desired altitude you will arrive at the target area. The most important thing to keep in mind when searching for cons is that you are are a spec in a three dimensional world. Ideally, the enemy will be below you but do not neglect to check the airspace on your altitude as well as the space above your aircraft. Be sure to make slight turns left and right in order to check your six oclock and six oclock low position. Also, keep track of radio chatter. Your airspace might be clear but there may be a big fight going on one sector away.

<li><b>Stalking</b>
	<p>
	Always before attacking a con that is unaware of your presence, you stalk them and position yourself in the most advantageous spot. This is the six o'clock low position. The reason that this position is ideal is that when your enemy pilot checks his rear view, he will not see any part of your plane. Against planes that have turrets, you will find that surprising the pilot is impossible because the turret gunners report everything they see. But the low six oclock position is still ideal for these planes because many of them have no belly gunner or insufficient belly protection. If executed correctly, you can approach in this position, briefly rise up to their level with guns blazing and kill the gunners on the enemy plane. After this, downing the plane is simple. The following is MOST IMPORTANT when you have finally found a con: The enemy is not AI. Very often they will set traps for you by sending one of their courageous to fly below you while the others hide in wait on your altitude or even above. When you engage the decoy, the other cons give chase. Thus, ALWAYS check all around your aircraft thoroughly before you engage a con. If you encounter several cons that are below your altitude, always attack the highest one first.

<li><b>Speed is life</b>
	<p>
	You will find that in air combat, speed is very important offensively and defensively. It can often make the difference between a favorable and an unfavorable outcome. In offense, engaging a foe at high speed makes it more likely that the enemy will be trapped and unable to flee from combat. It also increases the likelihood that you will be able to counter their defensive maneuvers.  With sufficient speed you can zoom up as high as possible. This is useful in both offense and defense. In defense, having high speed makes it more likely that you can outrun your pursuer. When fleeing is not an option, having sufficient speed makes it more likely that you can elude and perhaps even turn the tables on your opponent with well executed maneuvers.

<li><b>Gunnery</b>
	<p>
	The most important part of gunnery is to GET AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE (less than d3) BEFORE SHOOTING! The closer you are to the enemy, the larger the target will loom in your sights thus ensuring more hits.
